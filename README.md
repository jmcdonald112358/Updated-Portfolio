# Updated-Portfolio
This project is for an updated personal portfolio that incorporates better design and functional elements. It is a complete overhaul of the Responsive Portfolio built for Homework 2, utilizing a SPA approach that leverages JavaScript to dynamically generate page content. 

The page has been redesigned from the ground up, using the Bulma CSS library instead of Bootstrap, and incorporating actual project content as the portfolio instead of placeholder images. It is much more responsive than the original Responsive Portfolio; however, I still have some tweaking to do to improve how it appears on mobile.
